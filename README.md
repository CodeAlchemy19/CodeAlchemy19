# Hi, I’m CodeAlchemy19 👋
Senior Full‑Stack Developer & AI Engineer - building high‑performance web platforms and AI‑powered products that scale.

I’m a Full‑Stack Developer and AI Engineer with 7+ years of professional experience delivering secure, maintainable, and high‑impact software. I design and build end‑to‑end solutions - from fast, accessible frontends to resilient backends and data pipelines - and I integrate modern AI capabilities (LLMs, retrieval systems, autonomous agents) to add intelligence and automation to real products across fintech, healthcare, and ecommerce.

I turn complex requirements into elegant, scalable, and secure systems. I value quality engineering, clear collaboration, and measurable product outcomes.

## Core strengths
- Systems thinking: architecture, performance, observability, and security
- End‑to‑end delivery: product requirements → design → implementation → monitoring
- AI + product: architecting LLM integrations, RAG pipelines, and autonomous workflows
- Cross‑functional collaboration with PMs, designers, and data teams

- JavaScript, TypeScript
- React.js, Next.js, Vue.js, Medusa.js
- Node.js
- Python, Flask, Django, Java

Databases & Data Platforms
- MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- Firebase, Supabase
- Vector databases (for embeddings & retrieval)

AI & Machine Learning
- LLM integration, AI agents, autonomous workflows
- Prompt engineering, NLP, Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG)
- OpenAI API (and other LLM APIs)
- Vector DBs, embeddings, search pipelines

APIs & Integrations
- REST, GraphQL, Webhooks, OpenAI API
- Third‑party integrations and robust API versioning

Tools & Practices
- Responsive / accessible UI design
- CI/CD, Git, testing, linting

- AI‑powered automation for developer and product workflows

---

## Experience highlights
- Built and shipped full‑stack SaaS features with real‑time data and sub‑second UX for fintech and ecommerce platforms.
- Designed and deployed production RAG pipelines and vector search to surface relevant knowledge for customer support and knowledge automation.
- Implemented secure, scalable backend services (API design, DB schema, migrations, caching) and automated deployment pipelines.
- Led cross‑team efforts to integrate LLMs safely into products, with prompt versioning, cost monitoring, and guardrails.

## How I approach problems
1. Understand goals and metrics: what outcome matters to users and business.
2. Design a pragmatic architecture: tradeoffs, failure modes, and observability.
3. Build iteratively: small, testable increments with strong CI and type safety.
4. Measure and improve: profiling, analytics, and user feedback loops.
5. Ship responsibly: security, privacy, and cost controls for AI features.
